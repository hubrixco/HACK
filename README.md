# HuRiMa
## Hubrix Rights Manager

A RESTful API written in node.js to provide function-based access control (FBAC) to new applications as well as a number of existing ones.

We hope to introduce some innovations we believe will be a significant improvement over

* Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
* Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)

for some use cases.

Our initial focus areas:
 - Improving granularity and audit capabilites of rights/permissions management in open-source CMS and blog platforms
 - Building an API that allows rights and permissions to be managed across several domains / applications / platforms etc.

 ## Hey, why is there no source code here?
 
31 Oct 2017 update: **Hurima 1.0 is in development now.** Our initial release will be followed by a **closed Beta test** (limited to 100 users). You can sign up for the Beta here: https://www.hubrix.co/hurima-beta-signup/
 
 Hurima _will_ be an open source project, but our policy is to only post working, tested code on GitHub. Thanks for understanding.
