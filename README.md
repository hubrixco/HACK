# Hurima
## Hubrix Rights Manager

A RESTful API written in node.js to provide function-based access control (FBAC) to new applications as well as a number of existing ones.

We hope to introduce some innovations we believe will be a significant improvement over

* Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
* Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)

for some use cases.

Our initial focus areas:
 - Improving granularity and audit capabilites of rights/permissions management in open-source CMS and blog platforms
 - Building an API that allows rights and permissions to be managed across several domains / applications / platforms etc.
